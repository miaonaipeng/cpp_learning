/**
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become 
non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. 

 We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every 
i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2). 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one 
element.
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 n == nums.length 
 1 <= n <= 10⁴ 
 -10⁵ <= nums[i] <= 10⁵
